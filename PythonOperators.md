#### Arithmetic Operators
<pre>
+ 	Addition 	x + y 	
- 	Subtraction 	x - y 	
* 	Multiplication 	x * y 	
/ 	Division 	x / y 	
% 	Modulus 	x % y 	
** 	Exponentiation 	x ** y 	
// 	Floor division 	x // y
</pre>

#### Python Assignment Operators
<pre>
= 	x = 5 	x = 5 	
+= 	x += 3 	x = x + 3 	
-= 	x -= 3 	x = x - 3 	
*= 	x *= 3 	x = x * 3 	
/= 	x /= 3 	x = x / 3 	
%= 	x %= 3 	x = x % 3 	
//= 	x //= 3 	x = x // 3 	
**= 	x **= 3 	x = x ** 3 	
&= 	x &= 3 	x = x & 3 	
|= 	x |= 3 	x = x | 3 	
^= 	x ^= 3 	x = x ^ 3 	
>>= 	x >>= 3 	x = x >> 3 	
<<= 	x <<= 3 	x = x << 3
</pre>

#### Python Comparison Operators
<pre>
== 	Equal 	x == y 	
!= 	Not equal 	x != y 	
> 	Greater than 	x > y 	
< 	Less than 	x < y 	
>= 	Greater than or equal to 	x >= y 	
<= 	Less than or equal to 	x <= y 	
</pre>

#### Python Logical Operators
<pre>
and  	Returns True if both statements are true 	x < 5 and  x < 10 	
or 	Returns True if one of the statements is true 	x < 5 or x < 4 	
not   Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true   not(x < 5 and x < 10)
</pre>

#### Python Identity Operators
<pre>
is  	Returns True if both variables are the same object 	(x is y) 	
is not 	Returns True if both variables are not the same object(x is not y)
</pre>

#### Python Membership Operators
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object
<pre>
in  	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object 	x in y 	
not in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object 	x not in y
</pre>

#### Python Bitwise Operators (compare (binary) numbers)
<pre>
&  	AND 	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
| 	OR 	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
 ^ 	XOR 	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~  	NOT 	Inverts all the bits
<< 	Zero fill left shift 	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>> 	Signed right shift 	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
</pre>
